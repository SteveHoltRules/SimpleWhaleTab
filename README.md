# WHALE TAB
Whale tab's is a chromium extension that sets all new tabs to a random picture and a random quote. The intent is to give a mental break from the 'next' search to be executed, and instead either keep focus on the subject at hand, or to be reminded of things more concrete than keeping up with the latest news cycle, or technology trend.

## Progress

This is a post-dev bootcamp project intended to go over some of the items I learn and to continue to find ways to program outside of working hours.
